# About Cocokini?

From the Creator, Lauren Page: 

"I grew up in Corpus Christi, TX. and the beach was a huge part of my life from before I can remember. It was 2014 and I was 19 when I met the love of my life. His passion for travel, adventure, and surfing completely rubbed off on me. We started traveling together, he taught me how to surf and my love for adventure, the beach, and gorgeous bikinis grew! The only problem was that the basic XS-XL didn't work for me and I could never find a perfect fitting bikini that fit perfectly and also stayed put while adventuring. In February of 2015 I sat down at my sewing machine and made myself a high neck bikini top and cheeky bottoms. It fit me like no bikini ever had before and I was immediately HOOKED! I never planned to make a business of it as I was already busy running my embroidery business, but as I shared my work online I noticed a spark in interest from the girls in my hometown! It was then I worked up the courage to sell at my very first Farmer's Market and the rest is history! It has taken tons of trial and error and I am always working to build and better my skills. My ultimate goal is to always provide girls with a great fitting, fashionable, functional bikini that makes them feel like their best self."
